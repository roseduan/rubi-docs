# 7. Tools and Libraries Porting Guide

RUBIK Pi 3 has integrated the commonly used tools and libraries in development. If the tools needed during development are not integrated, refer to the following method of cec-client porting:

## 7.1 cec-client porting

1.  First, set up the cross-compilation environment. For detailed steps, refer to "1.11.2. Install cross-compilation tools".

```Shell showLineNumbers  
    source <your toolchains directory>/environment-setup-armv8-2a-qcom-linux
```

2.  Download libcec source code:

```Shell showLineNumbers  
    git clone https://github.com/Pulse-Eight/libcec
```

3.  Go to the cec-client source directory and execute the code:

```Shell showLineNumbers  
    mkdir build  
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../bin  
    make
```

After the `make` command is run, the following error occurs, indicating that the p8-platform library is not available.

To solve the problem, cross-compile the p8-platform library.

1.  Download p8-platform source code:

```Shell showLineNumbers  
    git clone https://github.com/Pulse-Eight/platform
```

2.  Go to the platform folder and run the following commands:

```Shell showLineNumbers  
    mkdir build  
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../bin  
    make
```

3.  Go to the bin directory and copy the compilation artifact to the *sysroot* directory of the cross-compilation toolchain. As shown in the following code, */home/zhy/QCOM/sdk* is the installation path of the cross-compilation tool. For details, refer to "1.12.2. Compile code".

```Shell showLineNumbers  
    cp libp8-platform.a /home/zhy/QCOM/sdk/sysroots/armv8-2a-qcom-linux/usr/lib/
```

4.  Go back to the libcec directory and continue compilation:

```Shell showLineNumbers  
    cd libcec/build  
    make
```

5.  After the compilation, run the following command to export the compilation artifact to the bin directory:

```Shell showLineNumbers  
    make install
```

6.  Run the following commands to view the compilation artifact. The cec-client tool has been generated, and the libcec library has been integrated into RUBIK Pi 3. Transfer cec-client to RUBIK Pi 3 for execution.

    :::tip

    Transfer files using the ADB or SCP method.
    :::

```Shell showLineNumbers  
    cd ../bin/bin  
    ls  
    file cec-client-6.0.2
```
