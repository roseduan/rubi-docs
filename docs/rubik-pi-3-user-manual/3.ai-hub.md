Qualcomm AI Developer Workflow

The AI/ML Developer Workflow serves as a comprehensive step-by-step guide aimed at assisting developers in efficiently preparing an optimized model, assessing its performance with the Qualcomm® AI Hub, and subsequently integrating the model into an application using the Qualcomm® Intelligent Multimedia SDK (IM SDK). The Qualcomm AI Hub offers an extensive collection of validated and optimized AI models to developers, which are designed for deployment on Qualcomm® and Snapdragon® platforms.

Developers can also incorporate their own models and improve them using the Qualcomm AI Hub workflow. Models are optimized to leverage hardware acceleration using all compute cores within the Qualcomm® AI Engine (CPU, GPU, and NPU). Additionally, they can be deployed on devices powered by Qualcomm platforms with a few lines of code. The Qualcomm IM SDK provides easy-to-use APIs and plug-ins that facilitate the integration of multimedia components and machine learning models, allowing developers to create a pipeline for deployment in an application.
